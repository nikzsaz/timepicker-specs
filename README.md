# timepicker-specs
I started working on the new specification of timepicker and datepicker. I am quite concerned about the complexity and ttl for each and
datetime operation. Since a beautiful datepicker and timepicker is already given by AngularUI Team. So i am trying to
consume the maximum efficiency from the given assets instead of making my own directive.
